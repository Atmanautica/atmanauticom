# Atmanauticom

A monorepo for:
- the headless Sanity CMS where we keep 'em integrated
- the static Next.js client that displays our posts and pages and work

## To install and run locally

TODO: make a TODO rake (ripgrep) that runs pre-commit and pulls all TODOs into a single file at the root of the monorepo
